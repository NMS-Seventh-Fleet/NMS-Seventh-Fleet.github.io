<p>…..shhhh…. do you copy….. ahh…. it’s working! 7th fleet if you can hear me? It appears as though the virus that had been plaguing our communication systems this year has been resolved by an unknown automatic update of some kind. We had ventured out to New Leyto to check on our mining operations and were stranded by a dust storm and then hit by a virus which prevented us from communicating or leaving the planet. Specialist Lucy clicked on some sort of unknown alien communication which completely shut us down. I guess after they found out we really weren’t paying their ransom, they let us off the hook!

<p>This update could not have come at a better time; our supplies are running dangerously low and I feared that we may have been lost forever. We desperately need to regroup the 7th fleet. Our capital ship is under repair at the moment, but we should be ready for departure by mid November, my how time flies. We will be returning to Sabn Omega shortly after. Stevensen out.</p>
