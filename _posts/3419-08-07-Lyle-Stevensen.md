<p>I left the Yorktown and descended to my base to speak to my exocraft technician who informed me that he needed Paraffinium from a tropical planet in order to build my exocraft platform. A quick scan of the 7th fleetâ€™s discoveries yielded a planet called New Yelsha in the Gunnas System. Upon warping there, the AI informed me that I had been awarded the surveyor medal as it had been my 20th warp trip. On the way into New Yelsha I was attacked by a pirate vessel, which I promptly defeated and was awarded another stripe for the defeat. I immediately found a spaceport on New Yelsha and identified a local stash of Paraffinium using my scanner.</p>

<p>The locals warned me that the Sentinels were very aggressive on this planet so I decided to fly to the deposit. As soon as I landed at the deposit and began to mine, a level 2 Sentinel walker popped up over the hill and began its attack. Terrified, I returned to my ship only to find that I was out of launch fuel. I initiated emergency protocols and send out an SOS signal. No response. With my time running low and few other options, I sprang from my ship and decided to run for it. Luckily I had my terrain manipulator on me and began to dig a cave. This worked and the sentinels deactivated. Although they deactivated, the sentinel walker still circled my ship. I decided to try to gather the necessary materials for the launch thruster while I waited until dark. Just as I suspected after dark, the walker had left and I was able to continue the mission by gathering the Paraffinium and constructing some launch fuel.</p>

<p>I am returning to my base to talk to my exocraft technician with the necessary building supplies to construct my exocraft. </p>

<p>Captain Svendsen arrived and we set out for an afternoon survey of the moon. I welcomed Captain Svendsen aboard the Yorktown to show him the new renovations that had been completed.</p>
