<p>I’ve been reading over the reports coming from Captain Jones and it doesn’t look good. It appears that the weather system on Sabn Omega has suddenly changed for the worst and is no longer sustainable. I have also received word that our ship repairs will be delayed.</p>

<p>I’ve sent captain Jones instructions to abandon the planet, find a new home for us and relay the portal coordinates to the 7th fleet so the rest of us can safely escape. I’ve instructed the teams here to find the portal on our planet at all costs. May God help us all.</p>

<p>Stevensen out.</p>
