<p>I woke up when a tentacle tried to strangle me.</p>

<p>While I was sleeping, Sabn Omega was corrupted by invasive lifeforms. All the native flora is gone. In its place are twisting, writhing masses of tendrils, more animal than plant. Some of them came up through the floorboards. They tie themselves into knots and bulbs, oozing and pulsating and glowing with a sickly light.</p>

<p>It's horrible. I don't understand how the entire planet could have changed so quickly. Even the air has turned gray and sour.</p>

<p>Everyone at the trading post has fled. I don't blame them.</p>

<p>It took me the better part of the day to free the Crimson Duck from the growth covering the launchpad. I'm still checking to make sure nothing got into the engines. My mission to resupply Capt. Stevensen has been postponed until tomorrow.</p>
