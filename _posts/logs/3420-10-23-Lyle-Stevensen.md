<p>More bad news. We ran out of food supplies and had to resort to hunting and scavenging local food supplies. Given that we are not familiar with this planet nor its lifeforms, one of us had to volunteer to be the “poison tester”. Steve, feeling extremely lucky and blessed to be alive, eagerly volunteered for this task.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the very first animal he killed, cooked, and consumed caused him to nearly immediately vomit into his space helmet. He started blindly running away from the camp screaming over a small hill. Samantha from our group was following closely behind but stopped short when she saw Steve’s vomit and diarrhea floating away in the low gravity towards the unusually beautiful sunset.</p>

<p>Needless to say, Steve didn’t make it. We carefully documented the animal so as to avoid it in the future. So far, no one else has volunteered to be a taste tester. We will camp here until we can come to an agreement.</p>
