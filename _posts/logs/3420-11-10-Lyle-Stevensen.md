<p>We have finally arrived at Captain Jones’s supply ship! As Captain Jones surmised, the ship did not survive the re-entry to our planet’s atmosphere. The ship was scattered across a large debris area the size of a football field. Luckily, Captain Jones had packed the supplies in indestructible containers. Steve was the first person to open one of the crates and pulled out a package of gamma weed cookies. He took one bite, smiled at me and then his entire body vaporized into a fine red mist. Steve is dead! I have ordered everyone to stay far far away from Captain Jones’ supplies until further notice. Luckily, none of us have really even needed these supplies because we have gained the ability to eat anything on this planet. However, it appears that we CANNOT eat anything off of the planet. I have sent the findings back to Captain Jones. Needless to say, our trip towards the portal has been delayed given these unfortunate circumstances. The crew needed time to properly bury and mourn the loss of Steve *AGAIN*.</p>
