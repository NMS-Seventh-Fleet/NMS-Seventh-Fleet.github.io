<p>Establishing a Mine on New Leyto I was able to colonize a mining operation on New Leyto in the Sionek System. It appears as though there will be a healthy amount of: Copper, Uranium, Sodium and Cobalt. I am running low on Magnetized Ferrite. I teleported back to Nerdnes HQ, flew to a planet and mined a ton of Magnetized Ferrite. I am now fully ready to begin my mining operation on New Leyto. </p>
