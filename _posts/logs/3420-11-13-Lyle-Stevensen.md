<p>Finally, some good news. The sandstorm has cleared and we should be to the portal on Tuesday evening. We still haven’t heard from commander Jones, I sure hope he has a rescue plan and that everything is ok.</p>

<p>We continue to make great progress towards the portal. If the conditions stay clear, we might even arrive early. The crew are all in great spirits, last night we even managed to make a “campfire” using our rover’s C.A.M.P. module and enjoyed the New Leyto stars. If you closed your eyes, you might actually think you were enjoying a campfire on earth. Of course, this illusion immediately goes away when you open your eyes and see your fellow “campers” bolted to their chairs around a holographic fire display. I must say that the suit’s campfire module does a fantastic job simulating the smell and the heat from an actual campfire. Speaking of smells, it is time to change Lobo yet again.</p>

<p>As the vehicle rumbled along the path today, my body began to ache. I can’t complain too much. I am in great shape for a 1,400 year old synth. Besides, with all of the advancements in bio engineering, I can easily purchase a new body after we have been rescued. Living forever without aging has some upsides. It is amazing what the scientists were able to figure out when they logged everyone’s DNA in order to cure the 2020 pandemic. It turns out that the “vaccine” was actually a military exercise to further the synth research. Despite this research, people didn’t start modding themselves until 2077, the year of the Great War. Living forever wasn’t exactly a choice. We all went underground to avoid the fallout, only to wake up in lovely West Virginia as a synthetic human. We were exact copies of our former selves. Our old bodies, destroyed. The “human” race would go on forever. </p>
