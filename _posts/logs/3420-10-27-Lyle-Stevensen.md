<p>The rest of the crew stayed up late into the evening of our last entry debating who would be the next taste tester. Exhausted from hunger and the debate, we decided to head to bed. Just as I was about to fall asleep, I heard a stir from the outside. I jumped up, grabbed my laser pistol, and ran outside ready to defend the camp. The extreme darkness on New Leyto prevented me from seeing hardly anything at all. From the sounds, whatever it was sounded like a moaning Zombie like creature that was feeding on the dead animal Steve had just eaten. I ran back to the vehicle and turned on the lights! It was Steve! Steve looked up from his dish and said: “Sorry Captain I didn’t mean to scare you! I woke up famished. Kind of a strange question, but what the hell happened to me? I woke up in a pile of my own filth in the middle of a ditch. Man this sure is a tasty animal!”</p>

<p>The next day, the camp faced an extreme choice: not eat the animal and starve or eat the animal, vomit, shit ourselves, pass out and live! One by one we all took a bite. Needless to say, none of us wanted to stay at that smelly camp location for very long, so we have continued our trek which we have slightly altered to the north to rendezvous with Captain Jones’ supply ship.</p>
