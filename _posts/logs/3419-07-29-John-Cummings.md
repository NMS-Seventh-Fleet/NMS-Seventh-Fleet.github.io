<p>Weeks after EMP blast. USS Alamo Location Unknown Fleet Admiral John Cummings A glorious war at the edge of the galaxy they said. Home by Festivus they said. No one mentioned that we would be up against a giant unmanned robot army, surrounded by systems of toxic planets with aggressive animals. Then, a mysterious ship appeared with devastating emp technology. Luckily our AI caught the signal in time and warped us quickly into the closest blackhole. Our escort squadron wasn’t as lucky. We’ve been radioing them for weeks with no response. Heading back into the blackhole is too dangerous and we are running low on supplies. We are initiating emergency protocols and are heading back towards home, the center of the galaxy. If they are alive, I hope those boys rely on the survival skills they learned at the academy.</p>
