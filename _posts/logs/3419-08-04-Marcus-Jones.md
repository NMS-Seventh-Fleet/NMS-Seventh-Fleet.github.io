<p>My scientist finally gave me the plans for a circuit board. Apparently his mind was elsewhere. Literally - he told me that he uploaded his mind to another star system for a vacation and left his body here in the base. For three days. The "conversations" we had were just his species' equivalent of "To leave a voicemail, press 1 now". I'm sure he's laughing at me now, assuming that Korvax can laugh. </p>

<p>My current problem is with my farmer. I need to grow star bulb for these circuit boards, but he refuses to teach me about it until I hand in some cactus flesh. And I do mean hand in. He's no more than five meters from the hydroponics table himself, but does he ever harvest anything? No. He refuses to accept any crop yields unless I personally place them on his desk. Anyway, I tried to convince him to teach me about star bulb while the cactus was growing, but the Gek has never heard of multitasking. He just tutted over my "lack of focus". Ugggh. This wise-old-mentor shtick is getting on my nerves. Maybe it was a mistake to hire the first lifeform who asked for the job.</p>
