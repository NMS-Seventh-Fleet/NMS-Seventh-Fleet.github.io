<p>We have completed much needed repairs on the Yorktown II. The entire inside of the ship has been painted black to increase morale. Our new storage rooms have also been installed.</p>

<p>As I was drinking my coffee this morning, my terminal began to blink. It was another Artemis signal coming from a holo terminal inside this very system.</p>

<p>I immediately ran for my ship and traced the signal to a nearby planet. The signal was coming from a long abandoned radio tower. I switched on the receiver and there, standing in front me, was Artemis himself.</p>

<p>The signal grew weaker and weaker. I realized that the signal would need to be boosted in order to continue my conversation with Artemis. So, I laid down a signal booster on every planet inside the system. When Artemis returned, he instructed me to use his translation module to become friends with the local Vâ€™ykeen population so that I could ask them to help me to locate Artemis. This module not only cost a fortune to install, but required me to hop around a planet  scanning random Vykeen artifacts.</p>

<p>I had my suspicions that the entire endeavor was some sort of wild Goose chase. When I could finally talk to the local Vykeen commander, he informed me that the  Artemis coordinates were a forgery.</p>
