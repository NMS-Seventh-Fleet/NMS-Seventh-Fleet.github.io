<p>The hard work was finally about to begin. The fleet had just finished construction on our new freighter, the USS Yorktown II. The crew all settled into their new battle stations. Our first mission would be to return the freighter to the Sionek System to collect all of the building materials that we had left behind on Sabn Omega and New Leyto. Lucy informed me that we only had enough fuel to make it to the Ekiton system, so we would need to stop into Captain Flanagan’s base, Sven 1, for fuel and to resupply. Over the intercom, Lucy told the crew to prepare to warp. I sat down in my Captain’s chair and was immediately disappointed. The damn thing didn’t spin. I am not sure how the builders of this ship expected me to Captain a vessel from a chair that does not spin. This would simply not do and would need to be fixed as soon as we arrive to Sven 1.</p>
