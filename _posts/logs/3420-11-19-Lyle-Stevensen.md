![Image of abandoned base, Sven1.](images/stevensen_3420-11-19_001.png)

<p>We arrived at Sven 1 and asked for permission to land. Oddly enough, no one answered our call. I decided to do a quick fly-over and noticed that the base was completely empty, no signs of life. After I landed on the pad, I did a quick scan of the departures. Captain Flanagan had left the base with his team over three months ago and had not been back. I found that to be a bit odd. When I went inside, I found the interior to be in immaculate condition as if all of the occupants had simply left to go on a quick space walk. Captain Flanagan even had an amazing office made of glass that had.... a swivel captain’s chair! Also, in my good fortune, I found that Flanagan had a few warp cells in his supply room. I quickly gathered both items...loaded them up. I left a note on his desk that instructed for him to meet us on Guythimar when he returned. I also left him an IOU note for his very comfortable swivel chair which I promised to return to him at our very next encounter. I hopped back in my ship and flew away wondering whether I needed to send an alert to command about his mysterious disappearance. I decided to wait and see. After all, I wasn’t in a giant hurry to return his chair.</p>
