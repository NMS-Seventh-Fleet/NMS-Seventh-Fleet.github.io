<p>Today I expanded my agriculture station on my primary base Sven HQ, which is in the Ektion system. If my math is correct, I should be able to harvest the plants with enough materials to create 1 circuit board each day. Circuit boards go for about 900k units on the galactic trade market, so this should prove to be a good income earner. I knew my pea farming days would come in handy.</p>
