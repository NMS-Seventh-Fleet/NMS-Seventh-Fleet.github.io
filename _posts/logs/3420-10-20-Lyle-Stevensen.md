<p>I have some good news, and some bad news. The good news is that Steve didn’t die when he was swept off of the cliff! In fact, he fell into the arms of a friendly, autonomous, robotic, surveying mech. Once the sand storms cleared, Steve and his Mech joined the “wagon train” as we continued West. Unfortunately, we ran into a river and were faced with two choices: we could try to ford the river or we could look for an easier way to cross further downstream. We decided to ford the river which ended up being a gigantic mistake. Two of the vehicles were swept away. We only made it out alive because Steve had the mech dive in and rescue us from near certain death. Thank God for Steve!</p>
