<p>“Take the space tour,” they said. “It’s completely safe,” they said. There I was, happily traveling to the moon when there was a bright light followed by an explosion. Next thing I know I’ve woken up on some infernal planet with no clue how I got there. I think I nearly died at least 20 times in the first hour, but I started to catch on. After getting access to a ship I met a number of strange alien races, and individuals keep calling me Traveller—maybe bc I travelled so many freaking miles to get here, and I can tell “here” is nowhere near home. Well at least I know one thing for certain—who I am: a ridiculously successful pea farmer from Minnesota that’s just trying to survive. The good news is there are a few friendly faces out here that will make surviving a little easier. There’s Capt Jones who is a very keen observer. His skills will definitely be an asset. There’s also Capt Patterson d, who just recently arrived, but he’s somehow related to Capt Jones, so I’m sure he’ll become useful soon enough. Then there’s Capt Stevensen, or as we used to say back on Earth, the “Wild Card.” I heard he’s been known to invite folks onto his freight just to space them as he warps off to another systems, leaving them to die under the cold grips of the vacuum. That aside he’s also been pretty helpful. Now that I’ve been blasting around these alien systems for at least a month or so I figured it was time to start documenting.</p>

<p>I was able to accomplish a few things on 3 Aug:</p>

<ul>

 <li>Killed a large sentinel force with the aid of Captains Jones and Stevensen. We even killed a Walker. I was able to extract its brain and use it in the creation of a Conflict Scanner which will aid me in my future endeavors. The Vykeen weaponsmith that works for me actually tasked me with these sentinels. I suspect he thought it was a death sentence, perhaps for him to take over my base himself, but I’m still here, buddy.</li>

<li>First Cadmium drive installed on my starship. This will allow me to warp to Red systems. I’m wondering if I should have installed this on my freighter instead, which would have allowed the other Captains to travel with me even if they didn’t have that technology yet.</li>

<li>Created an oxygen harvester at my base that is powered by carbon. I shouldn’t run out of oxygen any time soon. -Hired another frigate to accompany my freighter. This one is a support frigate that will aid my other two economy-based frigates on their lengthier missions. Hopefully it’s worth the Units.</li>

</ul>
