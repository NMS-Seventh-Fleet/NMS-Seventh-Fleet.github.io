![Captain Jones and Captain Stevensen on Guythimar](images/stevensen_3420-11-20_001.png)

<p>We have returned to Guythimar with all of the supplies from Sabn Omega. The crew is quite exhausted from condensing all of the materials and bringing them back and forth from the freighter. The Guythimar sunset was beautiful underneath the Thanksmas tree. We all had a lot to be thankful for. For starters, I was thankful that Captain Flanagan wasn’t here demanding back his extremely comfortable captain’s chair. I guess I should also be thankful that the rescue mission from New Leyto was a giant success.</p>

<p>Captain Jones and I finished unpacking my base on Guythimar. Bat cave 2 has been deployed. We set off across the planet and discovered a few waypoints.</p>

<p>The Guythimar base received a faint signal from.... Captain Flanagan! Damn it! I’m going to have to return his captains chair. I still have a few hours yet to enjoy it.</p>
