<p>I've reestablished contact with Captain Stevensen. He's dangerously low on supplies. I would fly over and drop some off, as I did before, but that's suddenly gotten a lot more complicated.</p>

<p>Apparently, not everyone who fled Sabn Omega was as careful as I was with their decontamination procedures. Over the past few weeks, settlers in several nearby star systems have reported localized outbreaks of the invasive lifeforms. (Thankfully, all were tamped down quickly.) In response, some of the local Vy'keen militias banded together and declared the entire Sionek system a no-fly zone. These guys are <i>not</i> friendly, and even if I can get past them once, I don't care much for our long-term survival odds in this sector if we tick them off.</p>

<p>I don't have any other methods of getting to New Leyto: I don't have the right teleporter permissions, and I still haven't cracked the portal network.</p>

<p>Then I remembered my new ship.</p>

<p>She's a hunk of junk that I found abandoned. I was going to scrap her, but she'll hold together long enough for the plan I have in mind.</p>

<p>I've cobbled together a way to fly the ship remotely. I'll load her up with supplies, fly her out to a remote part of the system where no sensors are scanning, point her towards Sionek and New Leyto, and hit "go" on the hyperdrive. One-way flight. Captain Stevensen gets his supplies, and the militias can't trace it back to me.</p>

<p>The tricky part is on the far end. The ship needs to come out of hyperdrive just before it hits the atmosphere, so the militias don't have a chance to shoot it down. It'll be coming in fast, but if my calculations are correct, most of the supplies will survive the impact.</p>

<p>Of course, if my calculations are <i>wrong</i>, the crater will be the size of a small city, and Captain Stevensen and his crew will be vaporized.</p>

<p>But if I do nothing, they'll starve to death.</p>

<p>They say fortune favors the boldâ€¦</p>
