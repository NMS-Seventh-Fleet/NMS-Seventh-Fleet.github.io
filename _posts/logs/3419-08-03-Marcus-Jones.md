<p>Dang virus. Wiped my logs AGAIN. Backups too. Where was I...</p>

<p>Captain Stevensen invited Captain Flanagan and myself to his base on Ipswi VIII to help him lure and then fight off a Sentinel Walker. In hindsight, I should have asked him how big a Walker is before I showed up. Three stories high, fires a laser beam as thick as my torso, and if the laser misses it can just step on you. Somehow we managed to take one down with our peashooters, but then two more showed up. At one point I hopped in my ship and flew 10 km away, and there was one waiting for me when I landed! Eventually the alert died down...at which point Captain Stevensen informed us that his on-board computer had glitched (is that where I caught this virus from?) and he hadn't been able to record any combat metrics, so the whole thing "didn't count". And so we went through the whole thing again...and it "didn't count" again. I ran for the teleporter before he could suggest trying a third time.</p>

<p>After that, I decided to devote some time to my hydroponics work. I was able to gather some cactus cuttings from Seusiouxf Ibos, a planet in the Bloche-Vut system that I found in Captain Flanagan's map data. The teleporter access codes that I've received from Captains Flanagan and Stevensen have been extremely valuable; I can't remember the last time I needed to go to warp in search of resources. I found that the weather on S.I. is pleasant enough during the day, but freezing at night, and the wildlife is rather aggressive. I constructed a teleporter anyway.</p>

<p>Back at Sporedrip Overlook, I planted the cactus cuttings and then finished adding the roof on the second story. No more toxic rain indoors. But my overall progress on the base is still stymied by the circuit boards issue: my overseer insists that his work cannot proceed without them, yet my scientist refuses to tell me how to construct them. In fact, he seems not to even hear me when I ask, though he is perfectly willing to discuss other topics. Have I stumbled into the middle of some obscure alien feud? Or maybe the Korvax is affected by this virus as wellâ€¦</p>

<p>On top of all this, I was able to squeeze in two brief rendezvous (rendezvouses?) with Lieutenant Patterson. His on-board computer still refuses to synchronize with the teleporter network (this virus, I swear), but he seemed in good spirits despite his hardships. I gave him some of my excess oxygen, and he cracked a joke about me stealing all the nearby copper before he could get to it.</p>
