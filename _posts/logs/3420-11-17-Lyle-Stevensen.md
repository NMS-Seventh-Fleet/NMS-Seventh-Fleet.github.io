<p>After a couple more entries on Captain Jones’ portable computer, the portal was correctly calibrated for Guythimar. One by one the team went through to lovely Guythimar. Oh and what a site to see it was! Flowing green hills with brilliantly colored mushrooms. It was a cross between Alice in Wonderland and the Shire from Lord of the Rings. We took a short range teleporter over to review Captain Jones’ amazing progress on our HQ. Lucy nearly broke down in tears when she saw our very neatly made bed that looked out over the ocean. Lobo of course jumped up and down on the bed, throwing the sheets into a disarray and the pillows onto the floor. The serene moment instantly evaded us.</p>

<p>Outside, Captain Jones’ team was busy decorating for the upcoming New Thanksmas celebrations. A tree was brought in an hoisted into place. Hot cocoa was passed out for all to enjoy while we watched the sunset over the water. It was good to finally be home.</p>
