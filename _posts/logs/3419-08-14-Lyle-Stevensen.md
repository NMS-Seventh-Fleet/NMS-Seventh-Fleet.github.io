<p>When I awoke from my slumber, I felt like I was suddenly smaller. I walked outside and looked at my spacecraft and felt like an ant. I’ve got to quit smoking those frost crystals. As, I started to look around, I immediately realized that my base had lost power from a mediorite shower. My teleporter was offline. Damn was that annoying. I was going to have to build a power station or evacuate to my base at New Leyto. I was growing tired of this planet anyways, so I decided that the best course of action was to permanently move to New Leyto. I deconstructed the base and moved to new leyto. When I arrived, I had forgotten what a crappy planet New Leyto was, so I was immediately frustrated. This was not a day for a hangover. I had remembered from reading Captain M. Jones’s log that there was a beautiful earth like planet in this system called Sabn Omega. I knew I had to colonize it. I was able to establish the Sabn Omega HQ at a local trading outpost. As soon as I did, Captain Raymond Patterson swooped in to check it out. He agreed that this was a very nice planet. I taught him how to drive an Exocraft. His eyes lit up as we drove straight up one of the tallest cliffs I’ve seen. This is a game changer he said. As night came, I stood on the edge of the cliff looking out, thinking to myself that this world looked like the one the elders would talk about; the ancient world of Halo.</p>
