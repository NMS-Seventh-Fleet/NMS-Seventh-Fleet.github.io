<p>Finally decided to try tracking down this anomaly that my sensors picked up ages ago. I knew it would take a few warp jumps. From Ricedenho to Huladebir (6-body system, picked up a shield upgrade at the station), from Huladebir to Cenaean (rescued a freighter, but declined to accept it as a gift; also bought a hyperdrive upgrade), from Cenaean to Ruziam (home to a "Foaming Planet", whatever that is), from Ruziam to Eltsyno-Najin, to Kahollyow IX (with its "Abandoned Planet"), to Altano (B-Class rifle for sale)...I stopped at no planets, only stations. The signal seemed to dance away from me, always a few star systems ahead. I gave up and returned home.</p>

<p>Then I tracked down a distress signal in my own home system and it summoned the anomaly to me. Funny how that worksâ€¦</p>
