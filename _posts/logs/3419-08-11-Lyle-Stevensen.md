<p>I accompanied Captain Flanagan on a trip to one of the harshest planets I have ever seen. I somehow activated a sentinel air force that followed me into space, and continued to follow me despite having activated my hyperdrive. The forces would respawn with even more ships if I shot one of their crew members down. Just when I had lost all hope, my ship froze in some sort of space/time continuum and I blacked out in pure fear and exhaustion.</p>
