<p>After reading my ship’s manual and talking over the issue with Jones, I realized that my technology must have some sort of virus. I hopped in my ship and headed to outer space where I could perform a reboot of my ship’s systems according to the manual. Powering down the spacecraft went smoothly but, I fear that I was unable to turn the damn thing back on. I drifted into a black hole and awoke, badly damaged on a strange planet in a system far, far away. My current spacecraft is beyond repair, but thankfully I found another close by thanks to my scanner. My current objective is to get things in order and head back to Sabn Omega as soon as I am able to build a teleporter. If this doesn’t clear the viruses, I’m not sure what will......</p>
