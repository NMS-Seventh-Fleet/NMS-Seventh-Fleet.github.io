title:  "August 11th 3419 | Lance Flanagan | Erittlei Major"
---

<p>My calculations were correct. The farming section of my main base yields exactly enough resources to produce a circuit board each time I harvest. $$$. I made a visit to Nada and Polo before embarking on today’s adventure. Nada gave me the blueprints for an Emeril hyperdrive and Polo gave me the blueprints for the Indium drive. Soon I’ll be able to visit green and blue systems. Today I departed for Luyski X, the first red system we’ve discovered. There were only three planets. The first, Bamp, contained interesting geometric shapes...like 3D octagons. The weather is described as “memories of frost.” The second planet, Irth, didn’t have anything remarkable, but I didn’t spend much time there. The final planet, Erittlei Major, was the harshest I’ve seen. It was extremely toxic and I don’t think Captain Stevensen was prepared for what he warped into. We discovered an interesting phenomenon. During the intense toxic storms, which occurred often, storm crystals exposed themselves in fair abundance—but only during the storms. These crystals net about 750k units for a stack of 5. Another potential income boon. Make sure to have advanced toxic protection and a stock of ammonia. One last note, a robot named Apollo (who claims he used to be an organic being) keeps hassling me to do work. I’ll have to check in with the rest of the 7th Fleet to see if they know anything.
