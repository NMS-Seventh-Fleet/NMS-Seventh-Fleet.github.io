<p>Found and excavated a local ruin. I dug up a chest with a jar of skulls inside, which I sold for a lot of money. I'm curious as to what the buyer is planning to do with the skulls, but maybe it's for the best that I don't know. Aside from that, I made a quick trip to Pingwold V to mine some uranium, and I shaved a few extra pieces off my base to reclaim the carbon. Still have no idea how to re-power my hydroponics trays. The wiring on those things is a nightmare.</p>
