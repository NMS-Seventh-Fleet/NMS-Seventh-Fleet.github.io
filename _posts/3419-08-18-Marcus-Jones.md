<p>Re-established teleporter functionality at Pingwold V and Ipswi VIII. Started work on an ammonia-and-copper mining outpost on my home planet of Achi 62/I7, though I'm out of advanced ion batteries again, so who knows when I'll be able to finish it.</p>

<p>Also, I had to tell my exocraft specialist that his wife and child had been brutally murdered. So that was fun.</p>
