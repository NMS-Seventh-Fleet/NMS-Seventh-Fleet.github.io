title:  "September 23rd 3420 | Marcus Jones | Sabn Omega"

<p>I've discovered that I don't have any logs from the past year. No, it wasn't a virus this time. I bought a speech-to-text plugin for my suit software some time back, and it has some very odd default settings, which I didn't notice until now. Settings like "always overwrite the previous file" and "transcribe the user's snoring, it might be an unknown language." Sigh.</p>

<p>So, to summarize the past year:</p>

<ul>

<li>I built a new base on Sabn Omega, close to Capt. Stevensen's base, at his request. The views at "Geronimo 4" are far better than what I had at Sporedrip Overlook (though I haven't torn that down completely), and my farming operation is twice the size. The only oddity is that Capt. Stevensen installed an experimental cloaking device on his own base, and it seems to be on the fritz. Some days I look over and his base is there, other days it isn't.</li>

<li>I acquired a new ship, the <em>Crimson Duck</em>. She doesn't handle as well as the Javelin Red—in fact, she handles like a brick on an ice rink—but she's got a lot more cargo space (especially after the upgrades) and her shields can take anything the pirates throw at me.</li>

<li>The Artemis situation is...resolved. I honestly don't know if I succeeded or failed. Though now I have -null- to converse about the nature of existence with. Just once, I'd like to meet a mysterious stranger who talks about the weather and what they had for lunch.</li>

<li>I fell out of love with autonomous mining units. They have a bad habit of turning up empty if you look the other way for too long. Either the units are glitching into reverse and pumping the minerals back into the ground, or thieving animals are filching the shiny stuff right out of the retrieval box. I'm hoping I'll have more luck with the industrial-scale deep mineral extractors.</li>

<li>I had a series of encounters with those big red spheres in the "Atlas Interface" stations. They kept giving me blueprints for smaller spheres to build. (Is that how they reproduce?) After I presented them with the last one, I was informed that my efforts had given birth to a new star. They didn't tell me where it was. I guess I was supposed to take their word for it?</li>

<li>I think that covers it. I probably could have gotten even more done if I had actually been working for the full year. But between the teleportation delay glitches, the hyperdrive temporal shielding failures, and that one disastrous cryo-sleep experiment, I had a lot of...let's call it "downtime."</li>

<li>As for the rest of the fleet, I haven't seen any of them in ages. Left their bases behind and scattered to the four winds. Not even a transmission. I'd send out my own messages, but I have no idea where to aim them. I hope they're doing all right. This galaxy isn't short of dangers.</li>

</ul>

<p><b>Addendum:</b> I just received a transmission from Capt. Stevensen! I can't believe he's been on the next planet over this entire time. The signal is surprisingly faint… Trying to pinpoint his exact coordinates so I can send my response. If he needs supplies, I'll bring as much as I can carry.</p>
