<p>Lieutenant Commander Jones discovered Ipswi VIII and established a base on our moon. I planted a crop and am waiting on it to grow. While waiting, I took off to go look for Vykeen Daggers and had no success. I encouraged Captain Flanagan from the USS For Pete’s sake to aid in the search for the mysterious Vykeen Daggers. After lengthy struggle to find vykeen Daggers, it was determined that the system we were searching for had no economy. We quickly departed for another vykeen system where the daggers were acquired at a trading post. I returned to base, turned in the daggers and harvested my fungus which had grown. After a successful voyage to harvest some balls, we returned to base to turn them in. Our scientists were able to fully research the exo-craft technology. The sentinel forces attacked our base so I issued an immediate evacuation of all personnel and materials back to his Frigate, the USS Yorktown. The battle with the Sentinels had been lost, but the war was far from over. I brought the USS Yorktown up to full readiness so that I could explore the mysteries of the universe from the comfort of my pottery barn captain’s chair. After the team had moved into the freighter, we performed some renovations, making the freighter smaller. We turned in the scrap for several hundred thousand units. We acquired a new x-wing fighter craft.</p>
