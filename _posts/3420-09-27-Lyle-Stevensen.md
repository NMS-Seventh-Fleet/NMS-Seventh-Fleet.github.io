<p>I’ve just received word from Captain Jones that a suitable replacement planet has been located, Guythimar! We’ve been saved! I’ve given the team the portal coordinates. It will be imperative that we find the portal on New Leyto to aid in our escape. I’ve instructed Captain Jones to deconstruct what he can and rebuild the new base next to the portal on Guythimar. We will deconstruct our bases here on New Leyto and bring our supplies through the portal here to Guythimar, then will portal back to Sabn Omega to deconstruct our base there as well.</p>
