<p>One of our crew members, Sargent Lucy was bitten by an alien while out on patrol. We rushed her to the operating room but it was too late, a baby alien was rapidly growing inside of her. Given that I was a skilled surgeon back on Earth, the crew agreed that I was the only one that could save her life so I performed the surgery alone. I had to make Lucy numb but awake. I held one of her hands while performing the surgery with the other. Something happened to me when I pulled the baby alien out of her abdomen with one hand. I felt an enormous sense of love for Lucy and the baby alien. I immediately collapsed to the ground in pure joy and passed out. It had nothing to do with all the blood. When I awoke, one of my hands was still holding onto Lucy and in the other the most beautiful alien that we’ve ever seen. Lucy looked at me an I looked at her. No more frost crystals for me I thought! I’ve got a family now!</p>
