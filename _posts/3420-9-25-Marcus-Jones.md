<p>Made my run to New Leyto to resupply Capt. Stevensen. Bad weather frustrated my landing attempts, so I had to switch to plan B: jettison the cargo pods and pray none of them landed on his head. I would have liked to see him face-to-face, but there will be time enough for that. Right now, as he reminded me, I need to focus on my mission: finding a new home planet.</p>

<p>I began my search by visiting Radforr VIII, the heretofore uncharted fourth planet in the Sionek system. (Not sure how we missed it earlier...) Unfortunately, it was radioactive, very stormy, and inhabited by giant sandworms. This might take a while.</p>
