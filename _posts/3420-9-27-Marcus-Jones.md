<p>Guythimar it is! But we have another problem. Capt. Stevensen's family situation has limited his transport options: he told me that the standard teleporters do not recognize his baby alien's bio-signature, and hyperspace travel would be dangerous for one so young. Hence, his insistence on using the ancient planetary portal network. It's the only way to get the child out of the Sionek system.</p>

<p>Since a connection between two portals can be initiated from either end, I decided to start where I already was. With the aid of some charts purchased from the local space station, I was able to locate Guythimar's planetary portal.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I couldn't decipher some of the glyphs in the portal interface. I'd already heard of these glyphs and even spent some time researching them, so I wasn't going in completely blind. Still, I couldn't figure out how to initiate a connection with New Leyto. I just didn't know enough.</p>

<p>Information on these glyphs is very scarce. It will take me some time to dig up the needed data. I'm polling my contacts for leads.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I've started work on the new base. It's rumored that portals release strange energies at the moment of activation, so to be safe, I'm building on the other side of a low ridge. If the walk proves too onerous, we can set up some short-range teleporters later.</p>

<p>The giant arrow isn't strictly necessary, but I'm hoping my fleetmates will get a kick out of it.</p>
