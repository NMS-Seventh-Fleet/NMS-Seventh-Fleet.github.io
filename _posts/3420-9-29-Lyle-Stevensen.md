title:  "September 29th 3420 | Lyle Stevensen | New Leyto"
---

<p>We are ready to embark on the month long journey to find the portal on New Leyto. The only problem is, we don’t have a working economy scanner. Hopefully this isn’t like finding a needle in a haystack! I’ve sent word to Captain Jones to test the portal on Guythimar to make sure that it works. As you know, before any long journey, we must update the log with who is on the risky mission in case any of us get lost.</p>

<p>On this trip, we have myself, Captain Lyle Stevensen. I am the commander of the USS Yorktown. I specialize in communicating with everyone else that does the actual work of this mission. If people only knew how to effectively communicate with one another, I would be out of a job. I am 5’9 and have no hair. My eyebrows are brown as is my beard. If you find my vehicle, my space suit, you will notice that they are all black and yellow after my favorite comic book character: Batman.</p>

<p>Next up, we have first officer and the love of my life, Lucy Stevensen. Lucy is a talented, talented, talented pilot and I am not biased at all. This mission would simply not be feasible without her navigating us through the up and downs. She is 4’11 what they would call a midget back on earth. Of course, her spacesuit is pink because she is obsessed with hello kitty which is odd because she is from Europe, not Asia.</p>

<p>Finally we have our son: “Logan Bob” or Lobo Stevensen. Lobo isn’t talented at anything yet, he is just a child. His spacesuit is yellow because it matches his favorite toy: a box of Cheerios.</p>

<p>There are a crew of 13 others with us but I am too tired to type and they are not that important.</p>
