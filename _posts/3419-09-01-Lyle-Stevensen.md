title:  "September 1st 3419 | Lyle Stevensen | USS Yorktown"
---

<p>I abruptly awoke on the bridge of the USS Yorktown at 3am. My room was full of smoke. I started to panic, then I realized that the smoke was just from the cigar that was burning in the ashtray near my bed. A perfectly safe place for an ashtray I thought to myself. I looked over in the bed next to me and saw the most beautiful alien life form sleeping next to me. After I rubbed my eyes, I realized I must have been hallucinating again. Damn frost crystals. Nothing in the bed except a yellow stain where I had pissed myself. Damn frost crystals. I got up to wash the sheets and grab a cold class of alien milk. As I came back from the mess hall, I stopped in front of the entrance to the bridge of the ship. This is why I love my job I thought as I stared out across the bridge of the ship at the vast star system that lay before us. We’ve been stationed in this star system for nearly a month. On Sabn Omega, we built one of the finest HQs in the fleet. Inside, we built a treasury to store a 1,000 units of 16 different resources. We also established a farm to harvest a crop of Starbulb. On New Leyto, we established a Uranium mine and gamma weed farm. Speaking of gamma weed, I haven’t yet tried to smoke that.... I headed back to bed..</p>
