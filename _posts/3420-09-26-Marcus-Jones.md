<p>We've had a stroke of luck. I found a strong candidate for resettlement back in the Bloche-Vut system, only 122 light years from our current home.</p>

<p>Guythimar is a lovely planet. Green hills, blue seas, golden skies, and remarkably calm weather. Plus, the thriving Bloche-Vut economy would give a boost to our trade operations. Sentinel presence is about average, but you can't expect a world to be perfect.</p>

<p>Loftusal XIV, in the same system, is a potential backup candidate. It's just as lush, but the weather seems more unstable. The skies darken frequently, and the locals warned me about "poison cyclones", though fortunately I didn't encounter any.</p>

<p>I transmitted my findings to Capt. Stevensen. I won't pull up stakes until we're in agreement.</p>
