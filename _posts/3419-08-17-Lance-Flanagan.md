<p>Returned to my base today to find that someone had stolen my starship launch pad. I suspect Rear Admiral Stevensen. He probably “commandeered” it for “official fleet business” or something. Anyway, I built a new one and also found that my base had grown too big and required supplemental power sources, so I rigged that up too. For some reason my hydroponics trays are no longer functional. I’ll have to look into that later. [Edit note: The planet used to be abundant in Pure Ferrite, but all of those minerals have mysteriously vanished. New minerals appear in their place which only contain Ferrite Dust. Fortunately they refine at a rate of 1:1, so just a minor setback. I’ve also determined that my mining laser now does more damage the hotter it gets, dealing nearly 3x damage at maximum heat. Is this a side effect of the extensive modifications I’ve installed?] I wrapped up the day with a visit to Nada and Polo. Man they made some major updates to their ship. I wish they would share some more of that tech with me. On the plus side they did spot me an upgrade for my multitool that increases resource gathering by 50%. I may have to double up on that one!</p>
