The good news is that we found a trading outpost with a pair of alien guides ironically named Lewis and Clark that claimed they could show us the way to the portal. The bad news is that the New Leyto sandstorm season is upon us that made flying there impossible; we would have to slowly drive a caravan across an area the size of the American West to get there. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">The trip started out innocently enough, but then we ran into problems. One of our tires blew out while crossing the first mountain range. One of our mechanics, Steve, was blown off a cliff after a 200 mph gust appeared out of nowhere while he was changing the tire. Luckily our vehicles have giant rods that can be pushed into the ground to stabilize the vehicles. We have been stuck here ever since. I will continue to send updates once we begin to move, which I hope will be soon; this vehicle is really starting to have a horrific smell coming from Logan Bob&rsquo;s diaper pail.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5 subtitle" id="h.dza8epqt3dmo"><span class="c9">October 3, 3420 | USS Absurdly Dignified | Captain Marcus Jones</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Another surprise today&mdash;Captain Patterson has returned to the local cluster!

After I rubbed my eyes, I realized I must have been hallucinating again. Damn frost crystals. Nothing in the bed except a yellow stain where I had pissed myself. Damn frost crystals. I got up to wash the sheets and grab a cold class of alien milk. As I came back from the mess hall, I stopped in front of the entrance to the bridge of the ship.

On Sabn Omega, we built one of the finest HQs in the fleet. Inside, we built a treasury to store a 1,000 units of 16 different resources. We also established a farm to harvest a crop of Starbulb. On New Leyto, we established a Uranium mine and gamma weed farm. Speaking of gamma weed, I haven&rsquo;t yet tried to smoke that....

Particularly ugly on the outside, but the inside was stunningly advanced. Makes the other stations look like country stores. It also seems that the interior might be bigger than the exterior? I&#39;ll have to take some measurements next time I visit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I introduced myself to the proprietors of the station, Nada and Polo. Friendly enough, but their conversations tend towards the cryptic. They remind me of my overseer. I&#39;d love to get all three of them in a room together. I could make a drinking game out of it: take a shot every time they mention dreams and visions, or cycles of rebirth, or being outside reality, or they pronounce the word &quot;traveller&quot; as though it has a capital &quot;T&quot;... on second thought, I would die of alcohol poisoning.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>The station&#39;s other inhabitants proved more helpful. I met a dozen species that I&#39;d never even </span><span class="c7">heard</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;of before, all ready and willing to trade. Except the base blueprints vendor - he just taped a note to his kiosk saying &quot;Back in five meznarks, help yourself&quot;. (I don&#39;t know how long a meznark is, but I have yet to see the guy.) I zeroed in on the bio-dome plans as a potential substitute for my still-malfunctioning hydroponics tables, but the blueprint was very sketchy. It seemed to assume that the builder already knew 90% of what to do, so it only supplied the missing 10%. I realized that I needed a good amount of salvaged data to fill in the missing pieces.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">On a lark, I spun through the &quot;recent connections&quot; log on the station&#39;s teleporter (who knew it had one of those?) and picked the first name that looked interesting: Snovoku IX. Turned out to be a three planet system: one irradiated, one cactus-covered, and one &quot;spiny&quot;. (I also spotted something that looked like a wormhole entrance, though I steered away from it.) Fortunately for me, the non-spiny planets had a lot of architectural data for salvage. My current theory is that a roving band of general contractors were playing pirate, burying their &quot;treasure&quot; on every planet they came across. Granted, that doesn&#39;t make any sense...but neither does any other theory, and mine is more fun than the others.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>After another visit to the anomaly station, which now appears to be stalking me, I received a surprise communication from the original sender of that distress signal that summoned the station in the first place. Her name is Artemis. She&#39;s a friend of Nada and Polo. Given that it&#39;s been over a month since the signal was first sent, I was very surprised to find that she was still alive. What little I could gather from her was - you guessed it - cryptic. The only point I really understood was that she was pinned down by </span><span class="c7">sixteen</span><span>&nbsp;enemies. Personally I&#39;m uncomfortable with </span><span class="c7">two</span><span>&nbsp;enemies - you never know if one is sneaking up behind you while the other one distracts you. I felt bad for her, but was I really equipped to deal with a force that size? I went back to Nada, to try to feel him out on how </span><span class="c7">urgent</span><span>&nbsp;this whole rescue thing really was; he told me that I should listen to Artemis&#39;s plea if it really </span><span class="c7">was</span><span>&nbsp;Artemis, and </span><span class="c7">not</span><span>&nbsp;listen to it if it was an impostor, and be cautious if it was some kind of </span><span class="c7">alternate version</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;of Artemis. Sadly, this was actually more helpful than I expected him to be.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>I returned to my base to install the new biodome and mull things over. Just as I was finishing my renovations, I got a surprise message from Captain Stevensen, who told me that he and Captain Flanagan were very interested in the &quot;foaming planet&quot; I&#39;d spotted in the Ruziam System. We rendezvous at the nearby space station and headed down. Bubbles. Bubbles everywhere. Even the animals were bubbles. There was also a fair bit of gold on the surface, so at Captain Stevensen&#39;s suggestion we set up a mining station. We came off with a big haul - enough for me to make enough solar panels to add a </span><span class="c7">second</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;biodome to my base.

And the craft allowed me to raid a supply depot for some rare, high-market-value resources. And then there was the hyperdrive upgrade I found in a lost probe. It turned out that the module came with a built-in micro-AI that instructed me on how to install it. Instructed me repeatedly. Incessantly. Without reprieve.

I was going to have to build a power station or evacuate to my base at New Leyto. I was growing tired of this planet anyways, so I decided that the best course of action was to permanently move to New Leyto. I deconstructed the base and moved to new leyto. When I arrived, I had forgotten what a crappy planet New Leyto was, so I was immediately frustrated. This was not a day for a hangover. I had remembered from reading Captain M. Jones&rsquo;s log that there was a beautiful earth like planet in this system called Sabn Omega. I knew I had to colonize it. I was able to establish the Sabn Omega HQ at a local trading outpost. As soon as I did, Captain Raymond Patterson swooped in to check it out. He agreed that this was a very nice planet. I taught him how to drive an Exocraft. His eyes lit up as we drove straight up one of the tallest cliffs I&rsquo;ve seen. This is a game changer he said. As night came, I stood on the edge of the cliff looking out, thinking to myself that this world looked like the one the elders would talk about; the ancient world of Halo.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5 subtitle" id="h.1xt1ee5ipox2"><span class="c9">August 13, 3419 | USS Yorktown | Captain Lyle Stevensen</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I decided to go back to visit my exocraft scientist on IPSWI VIII.

Today I departed for Luyski X, the first red system we&rsquo;ve discovered. There were only three planets. The first, Bamp, contained interesting geometric shapes...like 3D octagons. The weather is described as &ldquo;memories of frost.&rdquo; The second planet, Irth, didn&rsquo;t have anything remarkable, but I didn&rsquo;t spend much time there. The final planet, Erittlei Major, was the harshest I&rsquo;ve seen. It was extremely toxic and I don&rsquo;t think Captain Stevensen was prepared for what he warped into. We discovered an interesting phenomenon. During the intense toxic storms, which occurred often, storm crystals exposed themselves in fair abundance&mdash;but only during the storms. These crystals net about 750k units for a stack of 5. Another potential income boon. Make sure to have advanced toxic protection and a stock of ammonia. One last note, a robot named Apollo (who claims he used to be an organic being) keeps hassling me to do work.

I thought about hiring a specialist without his approval, but frankly I&#39;m afraid he would sabotage any co-worker he didn&#39;t like. He loves a good grudge more than almost anything. But no point dwelling on that now. All in all, things are looking good: the farm is running smoothly, my first exocraft is under construction, and I even have a trade terminal now (so no more running downhill to the outpost). With a bit of luck, it should be smooth sailing from here on out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5 subtitle" id="h.2nlg21tq2ulk"><span class="c9">August 11, 3419 | USS Yorktown | Captain Lyle Stevensen</span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image12.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I accompanied Captain Flanagan on a trip to one of the harshest planets I have ever seen.

Captain Flanagan was not so lucky; he only made it halfway before he got ejected into the vacuum of space. I swear that monstrosity is held together with scotch tape and twist ties. Either that, or it&#39;s deliberately booby-trapped. (Frankly I wouldn&#39;t put it past Captain Stevensen.)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">We eventually got Captain Flanagan back on board, and made it to the new system, Sionek, in one piece. (Miraculously.) The system had three planets, and we each chose one to explore first. My planet, Sabn Omega, was gorgeous: blue skies, lush green grass, and trees everywhere. You could almost take it for old Earth, except for the orange oceans. Shame the sentinels are so aggressive. In between dodging them, I was able to take a substantial number of Star Bulb cuttings before building a teleporter and heading home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Back at home, my cactus was finally ripe, so my farmer </span><span class="c7">deigned</span><span>&nbsp;to teach me the art of Star Bulb cultivation.

Well, almost: I&#39;m actually searching for the blueprints to the Advanced Ion Battery, so I can build an Autonomous Mining Unit, so it can mine the paraffinium for me (I&#39;m getting a little tired of mining by hand). Sadly, I haven&#39;t found it yet. On the other hand, I did find a gorgeous fighter at one of the space stations; after some haggling with its Vy&#39;keen owner, the </span><span class="c7">Javelin Red</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;is now mine. Coincidentally, it wasn&#39;t long after that when I came across an abandoned craft on a planet surface. So now I&#39;m up to three ships. This third is in very rough shape though, and I lack the resources to do proper repairs. I may keep it solely so I can get some trade-in value if I acquire a better ship later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5 subtitle" id="h.4c0s5e7vokg6"><span class="c9">August 07, 3419 | USS Yorktown | Captain Lyle Stevensen</span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image10.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I left the Yorktown and descended to my base to speak to my exocraft technician who informed me that he needed Paraffinium from a tropical planet in order to build my exocraft platform. A quick scan of the 7th fleet&rsquo;s discoveries yielded a planet called New Yelsha in the Gunnas System. Upon warping there, the AI informed me that I had been awarded the surveyor medal as it had been my 20th warp trip. On the way into New Yelsha I was attacked by a pirate vessel, which I promptly defeated and was awarded another stripe for the defeat. I immediately found a spaceport on New Yelsha and identified a local stash of Paraffinium using my scanner. The locals warned me that the Sentinels were very aggressive on this planet so I decided to fly to the deposit. As soon as I landed at the deposit and began to mine, a level 2 Sentinel walker popped up over the hill and began its attack. Terrified, I returned to my ship only to find that I was out of launch fuel. I initiated emergency protocols and send out an SOS signal. No response. With my time running low and few other options, I sprang from my ship and decided to run for it. Luckily I had my terrain manipulator on me and began to dig a cave. This worked and the sentinels deactivated. Although they deactivated, the sentinel walker still circled my ship. I decided to try to gather the necessary materials for the launch thruster while I waited until dark. Just as I suspected after dark, the walker had left and I was able to continue the mission by gathering the Paraffinium and constructing some launch fuel. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I am returning to my base to talk to my exocraft technician with the necessary building supplies to construct my exocraft. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image23.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Captain Svendsen arrived and we set out for an afternoon survey of the moon.

Apparently he had fallen into a sticky situation with a sentinel walker, but by the time I got the old ship online, he managed to escape home. I was in need of Paraffinium in order to plant Star Bulb, so I teleported to Stevensen&rsquo;s HQ, because I knew his moon was rich with it. We set out together in our Roamers, and it turns out I had already mined most of the Paraffinium in the area, so our journey took some time. We also were able to use the advanced scanner on the Roamer to locate a drop pod! Capt Jones warped into the area and we determined it best to board Capt Stevensen&rsquo;s freighter and explore a new system. Shortly before departing, I was minding my own business aboard the freighter when Capt Jones saw fit to somehow toss me out the airlock where I nearly died. I&rsquo;m still not sure exactly what happened, but he claims it was an accident. I&rsquo;ll have to keep my eye on him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Upon reaching the new system, Sionek, we discovered three planets, so the three of us split off. I&rsquo;m not sure what was available on Stevensen&rsquo;s planet New Leyto, but it was one of the largest planets I&rsquo;ve ever seen. The ring system seemed to go on forever. I explored a small toxic planet, Lepusch, where I found an ancient ruin that was mostly buried. I was able to dig up three keys that opened the ancient chest, which contained a rare hoop over 1,000 years old. It seemed pretty worthless to me, but it scored over 600,000 units on the trade network. The most curious thing about that ruin was that there were no toxins present despite being out in the open. Before leaving the planet I discovered multiple instances of &ldquo;metal fingers,&rdquo; and I left with over 1000 uranium! Capt Jones&rsquo;s planet, Sabn Omega, was lush, and of course high security. I decided to visit when he reported little sentinel activity, and it was quite a beautiful planet, though I&rsquo;m not sure if there&rsquo;s any significant resource value.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">I teleported back to my base. My base computer had uncovered the archived blueprints for a launch pad, which I quickly installed on the side of my headquarters. This will save me a lot of launch fuel! Such good news until my fleet commanders comm&rsquo;d in and shared with me that all three of my frigates were damaged on their last voyage...utterly worthless. I repaired them and thought I had seen enough for one day. Before going to sleep I was determined to look at the nearest red system, since my new hyperdrive is capable of reaching them. While scanning the system, I unintentionally engaged the warp drive...so much for going to sleep. Upon reaching the destination, Luyski X, I encountered a monstrous freighter&mdash;far bigger than any I had seen by a factor of 3&mdash;and it was under pirate attack. I defended the freighter and its captain invited me aboard. He was extremely grateful for my assistance, and he seemed like he wanted to give me the freighter, but it was for a price of 90 mil units. I quickly left the area and teleported home. I&rsquo;ll have to return to scout the planets another day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5 subtitle" id="h.teltzzz3xxjh"><span class="c9">August 04, 3419 | USS Absurdly Dignified | Captain Marcus Jones</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">My scientist finally gave me the plans for a circuit board. Apparently his mind was elsewhere. Literally - he told me that he uploaded his mind to another star system for a vacation and left his body here in the base. For three days. The &quot;conversations&quot; we had were just his species&#39; equivalent of &quot;To leave a voicemail, press 1 now&quot;.

He&#39;s no more than five meters from the hydroponics table himself, but does he ever harvest anything? No. He refuses to accept any crop yields unless I personally place them on his desk.

In hindsight, I should have asked him how big a Walker is before I showed up. Three stories high, fires a laser beam as thick as my torso, and if the laser misses it can just step on you. Somehow we managed to take one down with our peashooters, but then two more showed up. At one point I hopped in my ship and flew 10 km away, and there was one waiting for me when I landed! Eventually the alert died down...at which point Captain Stevensen informed us that his on-board computer had glitched (is that where I caught this virus from?) and he hadn&#39;t been able to record any combat metrics, so the whole thing &quot;didn&#39;t count&quot;. And so we went through the whole thing again...and it &quot;didn&#39;t count&quot; again. I ran for the teleporter before he could suggest trying a third time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">After that, I decided to devote some time to my hydroponics work. I was able to gather some cactus cuttings from Seusiouxf Ibos, a planet in the Bloche-Vut system that I found in Captain Flanagan&#39;s map data. The teleporter access codes that I&#39;ve received from Captains Flanagan and Stevensen have been extremely valuable; I can&#39;t remember the last time I needed to go to warp in search of resources. I found that the weather on S.I. is pleasant enough during the day, but freezing at night, and the wildlife is rather aggressive. I constructed a teleporter anyway.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Back at Sporedrip Overlook, I planted the cactus cuttings and then finished adding the roof on the second story. No more toxic rain indoors. But my overall progress on the base is still stymied by the circuit boards issue: my overseer insists that his work cannot proceed without them, yet my scientist refuses to tell me how to construct them. In fact, he seems not to even hear me when I ask, though he is perfectly willing to discuss other topics. Have I stumbled into the middle of some obscure alien feud? Or maybe the Korvax is affected by this virus as well&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">On top of all this, I was able to squeeze in two brief rendezvous (rendezvouses?) with Lieutenant Patterson. His on-board computer still refuses to synchronize with the teleporter network (this virus, I swear), but he seemed in good spirits despite his hardships. I gave him some of my excess oxygen, and he cracked a joke about me stealing all the nearby copper before he could get to it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5 subtitle" id="h.vpuybo6n8nbv"><span class="c9">August 03, 3419 | USS Yorktown | Captain Lyle Stevensen</span></p><p class="c3"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px;"><img alt="" src="images/image14.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 350.67px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Lieutenant Commander Jones discovered Ipswi VIII and established a base on our moon.

After lengthy struggle to find vykeen Daggers, it was determined that the system we were searching for had no economy. We quickly departed for another vykeen system where the daggers were acquired at a trading post. I returned to base, turned in the daggers and harvested my fungus which had grown. After a successful voyage to harvest some balls, we returned to base to turn them in. Our scientists were able to fully research the exo-craft technology. The sentinel forces attacked our base so I issued an immediate evacuation of all personnel and materials back to his Frigate, the USS Yorktown. The battle with the Sentinels had been lost, but the war was far from over. I brought the USS Yorktown up to full readiness so that I could explore the mysteries of the universe from the comfort of my pottery barn captain&rsquo;s chair. After the team had moved into the freighter, we performed some renovations, making the freighter smaller. We turned in the scrap for several hundred thousand units.

Bottom line..advance the story and you&rsquo;ll start making a lot more money.</span></p><h1 class="c6" id="h.d8hvwctof4yz"><span class="c16">Refinery Tricks:</span></h1><ul class="c11 lst-kix_kufukwtjqf3z-0 start"><li class="c3 c8 c1"><span class="c2">50 Sodium + 50 Sodium Nitrate = 1 Destab Sodium</span></li><li class="c3 c8 c1"><span class="c2">1 Destabilized Sodium = 150 Sodium Nitrate</span></li><li class="c3 c8 c1"><span class="c2">1 Cadmium + 1 Chromatic Metal = 4 Cadmium</span></li><li class="c3 c8 c1"><span>1 Cadmium = 1 Chromatic Metal</span></li></ul><h1 class="c6" id="h.tz7o2zx4mchb"><span class="c16">Survival:</span></h1><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Always charge your shields and equipment with the condensed version of a resource &nbsp;i.e. &nbsp;sodium nitrate, magnetized ferrite, condensed carbon. &nbsp;This will save you a lot of time Bc the condensed versions are much more efficient (i.e. better than 2:1).</span></p><p class="c14 subtitle" id="h.gbi2tyxog3tf"><span class="c20"></span></p><h1 class="c6" id="h.2rrgyfcxewus"><span class="c16">Equipment and Technology:</span></h1><p class="c3"><span class="c2">You can use Uranium as launch fuel for your starship. Uranium is available in very large quantities from &ldquo;Metal Fingers,&rdquo; symbolized on your analysis visor as yellow &ldquo;III&rdquo;. &nbsp;A Metal fingers deposit is typically a mix of uranium, gold, silver, and platinum. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">When in space combat, you can recharge your ship&rsquo;s shield with sodium nitrate, which will dramatically increase your survivability. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Every space station has a single exosuit slot expansion available by paying Units. It looks like a holographic version of an exosuit that you interact with. Recommend you expand either your technology slots or your main inventory. &nbsp;High capacity cargo is very expensive to expand. Drop Pods that can be found on planets also provide exosuit expansion at the same resource cost regardless of which section you expand...so recommend you use drop pods to expand your High Capacity Cargo (these slots hold 500 instead of 250). </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">Every space station has four vendors on the right side (as you look out to space). Exosuit, exocraft, spacecraft, and multi tool. You can trade nanites for either blueprints or upgrades. Do not waste your nanites on B or C class upgrades...A and especially S class upgrades tend to be far, far superior and don&rsquo;t cost that much. I recommend you get one S class scanner upgrade for your multi tool bc you will start getting a lot of money for scanning fauna and flora. &nbsp;S class life support, defense, and movement upgrades from the exosuit guy will also make your life a little better (keep in mind not every space station sells the same upgrades&mdash;you may have to search). &nbsp; Eventually... you will also want to get the environmental protection modules from the exosuit vendor. You&rsquo;ll want one for each environment&mdash;Cold Weather, Hot Weather, Radiation, and Toxic. These shields work like your normal environmental protection where they tick down and have to be recharged. They are powered by Doxite, Phosphorous, Uranium, and Ammonia respectfully.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c21"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c14 subtitle" id="h.gxmx13etw4jy"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c14 subtitle" id="h.qra7npk38eqv"><span class="c9"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span></p></body></html>
